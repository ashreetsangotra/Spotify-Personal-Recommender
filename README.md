# Spotify-Personal-Recommender


If you use Spotify as your main music app, you definitely know about Discover Weekly!  Every Monday you get a new playlist of 30 songs based on your listening history and likes. In my experience, Spotify has the best recommendations and is designed for discovering Music  unique to your taste. I usually end up listening to Discover Weekly playlist on Monday itself. 
With this post I want to make an attempt to find out more songs that I like!
